TweetSeq is a prototype Processing application written using twitter4j for 
Twitter integration, and the minim library for sound.
Based on the idea of using data sourced from twitter to create music, TweetSeq
is a simple sequencer for arranging tweets to create interesting sound loops.
Each sound is based on the tweet's textual contents.
Create a loop by dragging tweets from the right hand column into the 
sequencer and pressing the play button.
