TweetSeq is a prototype Processing application written using twitter4j for 
Twitter integration, and the minim library for sound.
Based on the idea of using data sourced from twitter to create music, TweetSeq
is a simple sequencer for arranging tweets to create interesting sound loops.
Each sound is based on the tweet's textual contents.
Create a loop by dragging tweets from the right hand column into the 
sequencer and pressing the play button.
Right click on tweets in the right column to play their sound. Right click on
tweets in the sampler to remove them.
Buttons at the top of the screen allow you to play/pause and stop, and refresh
the list of tweets.

The following libraries are needed in your Processing installation's libraries directory for the source project to run:
- peasycam version 2
- SimpleOpenNI version 1.96

Other required libraries are included in the project code directory.
